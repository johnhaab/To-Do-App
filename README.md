# SimpleTasks

**SimpleTasks** is my first Python project. It's a command-line based to-do list application that allows you to manage your tasks, set priorities, and keep track of due dates. I learned a lot while building this project and wanted to share it with others. Feel free to use, modify, or report any issues on the GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/johnhaab/SimpleTasks)

## Learning Experience

SimpleTasks is my very first Python project. While building it, I learned about file handling, data storage with JSON, input validation, and more. The project allowed me to explore various aspects of Python programming, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

Feel free to contribute to the project, report bugs, or suggest improvements. Your feedback is invaluable as I continue learning and growing as a software engineer.
